# At the Hour of Annihilation

## Forward
November 2019, as a lark, a small collection of amateur theatre enthusiasts unwittingly began drafting [an original stage-play](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M_bp2vOEIlvXp-hv4aCaoiU3qeLlvKdlyH81C5zF2lw/edit?usp=sharing) featuring a world being destroyed by a coronavirus. The script was declared “ready” and casting began in February 2020, planning to unleash the premiere upon an unsuspecting Berlin audience in April 2020.

How do you make a God laugh?
Tell him your plans.

By March 2020, it became evident that we were not just casting characters but casting prophecy. What we wanted to put on a small stage, was in fact to be played out upon all the world!

The original production was set to hit the stage on 2018 April 18.  While lockdowns forced us to postpone the theatrical production, some members of Lost Thespians agreed the show must go on.  Thus we are adapting the play for "radio" presentation.
